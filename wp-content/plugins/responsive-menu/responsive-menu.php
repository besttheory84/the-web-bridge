Responsive Menu - A WordPress Responsive Menu Plugin



@package  WordPress Responsive Menu

@author   Peter Featherstone <hello@peterfeatherstone.com>



|--------------------------------------------------------------------------

| A note on Namespaces (or lack of)

|--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

Unfortunately, due to ~70% non-support for NameSpaces all Classes are pre-fixed

with the RM_ tag to avoid conflict, will be updated to use Namespaces when and 

if it becomes a requirement for WordPress.



It's a bit ugly but it's the best way for compatibility with other plug-ins and 

all WordPress users.

| Bootstrap The Application

|--------------------------------------------------------------------------

|

| This bootstraps the Responsive Menu and gets it ready for use, then it

| will load up the Responsive Menu application so that we can run it.

require_once 'app/bootstrap.php';



/*

| Run The Application

|--------------------------------------------------------------------------

|

| Once we have the application, we can simply call the run method,

| which will setup everything we need to display the Responsive Menu 

| straight out the box with no extra customisation needed.
